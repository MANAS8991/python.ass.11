    "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() to display messages for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Granular control: Logging allows you to control the level of messages that are displayed or logged. You can set different levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) for different parts of your code, which provides more flexibility in managing the verbosity of your program. In contrast, using print() statements requires manual addition or removal of statements to control the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log levels and filtering: With logging, you can set different log levels and filter messages based on their severity. This allows you to easily prioritize and filter the output based on the current needs of your application. For example, during development, you might want to see detailed debug messages, but in production, you might only be interested in critical error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configurability: Logging provides a way to configure logging behavior through configuration files or code, allowing you to change logging settings without modifying the code. This makes it easier to enable or disable logging, change log formats, redirect log output to different destinations (e.g., file, console), or integrate with external logging systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured logging: Logging allows you to log structured data along with the messages, such as timestamps, module names, and additional context. This can be valuable for troubleshooting and analysis purposes, as it provides more information about the log events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with libraries and frameworks: Many libraries and frameworks utilize logging, making it easier to integrate with existing logging infrastructure and handle logs consistently across different parts of your application. It also allows you to capture logs from external dependencies and libraries used in your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, logging provides a more flexible, configurable, and standardized approach to managing and controlling program output, making it a preferred choice over using print() statements for displaying messages in most production-grade applications."

    "\n",
    "Step Over: The Step Over button allows you to execute the next line of code without stepping into any function calls. If the next line contains a function call, it will be executed as a whole, and the debugger will move to the next line after the function call returns. It is useful when you want to quickly move through a function call without stepping into its implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step In: The Step In button allows you to step into the next line of code, including any function calls. If the next line contains a function call, the debugger will enter that function and start debugging its implementation. This is useful when you want to examine the details of a particular function and step through its code line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Out: The Step Out button is used when you are already inside a function and want to quickly execute the remaining lines of code in that function without stepping through each line individually. It allows you to \"step out\" of the current function and return to the calling function. The debugger will continue execution until it reaches the line after the function call that originally brought you into the current function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Step Over button executes the next line without stepping into function calls, the Step In button enters the next line including function calls, and the Step Out button executes the remaining lines in the current function and returns to the calling function. These buttons provide different levels of control and granularity when debugging your code.\n"
